# Objective-C KVO Crash: Observer Not Removed Before Deallocation

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO).  Failure to properly remove KVO observers before the observed object is deallocated can lead to crashes due to attempts to access memory that has been freed.

The `bug.m` file shows the problematic code, where an observer is added but not correctly removed.  The `bugSolution.m` demonstrates the correct way to handle observer removal to prevent this crash.

This is a crucial aspect of memory management and robust application development in Objective-C.  Always ensure that observers are removed using `removeObserver:` in appropriate lifecycle methods such as `dealloc` or before releasing the observed object.
