To fix this, ensure that the observer is removed using `removeObserver:` before the observed object is deallocated.  The best practice is to remove the observer in the `dealloc` method of the observer object or whenever the observation is no longer needed.  Alternatively, use a context to manage and remove multiple observers.

```objectivec
@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [self removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"observedString"];
    [super dealloc];
}

//Or using context for more complex scenarios:
- (void)startObservingWithContext:(void *)context {
    [self addObserver:self forKeyPath:@"observedString" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:context];
}
- (void)stopObservingWithContext:(void *)context {
    [self removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"observedString" context:context];
}
@end
```
This ensures that the observer is always removed, preventing crashes and maintaining the stability of your application.
